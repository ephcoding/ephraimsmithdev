Hey guys. I'm Ephraim Smith. An aspiring mobile developer. My goal with ephcoding.com is to help others trying to break into software by sharing everything I build and learn.

Here's a little bit about me..

I'm 37 and don't come from anything even close to a coding background. So, the struggle's very real for me. In a lot of ways:

- I over-analyse
- I procrastinate
- I get up at 3:00 am every day to "get ahead" and have gotten nowhere
- I avoid holding myself accountable by pretending to be too busy to get everything done
- I dwell and waste time on trivial shit that doesn't contribute to the endgame just for the 'quick-win quick-fix'
- I've changed 'the plan' more times than I can count
- I switch gears every time I question my latest decision
- I've put in 12-hr days for the last 4 years trying to break into development
- I've strained my marriage as a result
- I've missed valuable time with my kids
- I've averaged 4 hours sleep/night convinced that more time in is more time out

This wasn't the plan. Or my intention. How'd I get here? I'm stalling. I care what people think. The second I build and put something out there, my time and emotional investment is fair game to criticism.

But I'm not getting any younger and the life I'm working to create for my family isn't going to happen by itself.

So, fuck it. Here's [https://www.ephcoding.com](ephcoding.com). The first thing I've built start-to-finish.

It needs a lot of work. But then again, so do I.
