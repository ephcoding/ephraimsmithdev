Hey guys. I'm Ephraim Smith. An aspiring mobile developer. My goal with ephcoding.com is to help others trying to break into software by sharing everything I build and learn.

I'm 37 with a wife and 2 kids. I left a 6-figure construction career in 2018 to pursue software and focus on the things that matter.

I had _zero_ software experience. So, the struggle's been very real. Here's a little more about me..

- I overanalyze
- I procrastinate
- I get up at 3:00 am every day to "get ahead" and have gotten nowhere
- I avoid holding myself accountable by pretending to be too busy to get everything done
- I dwell and waste time on trivial shit that doesn't contribute to the endgame just for the 'quick-win quick-fix'
- I've changed 'the plan' more times than I can count
- I switch gears every time I question my latest decision
- I've put in 12-hr days for the last 4 years trying to break into development
- I've strained my marriage as a result
- I've missed valuable time with my kids
- I've averaged 4 hours sleep/night convinced that more time in is more time out

  <br>

  This wasn't the plan. Or my intention.

How'd I get here? I'm stalling. I care what people think. The second I build and put something out there, my time and emotional investment is fair game to criticism.

But I'm not getting any younger and the life I'm trying to create for my family isn't going to create itself.

So, fuck it. Here's [ephcoding.com](https://www.ephcoding.com). The first thing I've built start-to-finish. Hopefully, I'll see you out there.

P.S. It's rough. But then again, so am I.
